# Amazon Clone

## **Description**
This project is a simplified front-end clone of Amazon, demonstrating basic e-commerce functionalities such as product display, searching, adding items to a cart, and viewing product details in a modal.

## **Features**
*   **Product Listing**: Displays a list of featured products with their names, prices, and images.
*   **Product Search**: Allows users to search for products by name using a search bar.
*   **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to a shopping cart.
*   **Cart Management**: The cart sidebar shows added items and calculates the total price. Items can be removed from the cart.
*   **Product Details Modal**: Clicking on a product card (excluding the "Add to Cart" button) opens a modal displaying more details about the product, including its description.
*   **Responsive Design**: Basic responsive layout for different screen sizes.

## **Technologies Used**
*   **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the web pages.
*   **CSS3**: For styling the application, including layout, colors, and responsiveness.
